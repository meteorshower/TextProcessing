# Text Pre-processing

Pre-processing of text, before analysis often involves many steps. The main steps, in no particular order are:

1. Reading in multiple text files from a directory
2. Break down text into sentences
3. Lower case all characters in each sentence
4. Perhaps remove punctuation marks
5.Break down the sentences into words

Of course depending on the problem at hand, the corpus requires any of the above steps to be performed.
